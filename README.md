<h2> What have I learned </h2>

<li> I've contiuned to use basic Javascript to complete tasks in projects </li>
<li> I've improved my ability to mainuplate the DOM with Javascript </li>
<li> I've improved my ability to deal with small bugs and frustrating issues that come my way while programming </li>
<li> I've contiuned to use pseudo code to solve problems and issues </li>

<h2> How did I complete this project? </h2>

<p> I started by creating all the HTML elements and assigning them classes. I moved onto the CSS, and started by adding the background color to body. Next, I started to design the card, and spent some time experimenting with small details until I go the look I liked. I then moved to styling elements like text, and buttons. Then, I moved onto the Javascript. I used pseudo code to figure out how I was going to create a system to hide and show answers to questions. After encountering small bugs such as the heights being changed after deselecting answers, I got the look and functionally I wanted. Overall, this project helped me improve my problem solving skills, and allowed me to further improve my basic Javascript skills. Once I finished, I tested the website on multiple browsers, and used the built in device size emulation feature to view what the website would look like on different devices. My next steps, would be to spend more time thinking and writing things out instead of using trial and error to solve issues and bugs. </p>
